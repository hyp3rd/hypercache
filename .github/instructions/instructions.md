# Basic instructions

Always run `golagci-lint` and staticcheck after completing a Golang task.
Verify the quality of the code you provide, including repetitions, flaws, and ways to modernise the approach to ensure consistency. Adopt a development method and stick consistently to it.
Parse the Makefile in the project, and you will find the commands you need to lint, polish, and test the code.

Always document the solutions we find, and where applicable, use the ./docs folder for extensive documentation.

## Toolset

- [Makefile](../../Makefile).
- Always run: `make lint`
